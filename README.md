# part-of-speech-taggin-portuguese

The file "find_verbs_nouns" use part of speech tagging (POS) methodology to find the verbs and nouns of a corpus in Portuguese.

The POS methodology did not presented satisfactory results in verbs search, so the file "find_verbs" implements a verb search using the most frequent verbs endings in portuguese.

The "categorization" file contains the code to categorize the rows into the right categories (see the category map) using cluster of words.
